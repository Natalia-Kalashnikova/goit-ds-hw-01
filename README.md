# ðŸ“’ Contact Book (Address Book) â€” Console Assistant Bot

A simple command-line contact book assistant bot written in Python 3.13, using object-oriented programming principles.

This console bot helps you manage contacts: add, edit, delete, and search for phone numbers. Contacts can have multiple phone numbers, and each phone number is validated (must be exactly 10 digits). Additionally, contacts can store a birthday date, which is validated and used to track upcoming birthdays and send timely greetings.

This address book is automatically saved to disk when you exit the program and restored when you start it again, so you never lose your contacts!

## ðŸ’¾ Data Persistence

- All your contacts and their data are automatically saved to a file (addressbook.pkl) when you exit the program.

- When you start the program again, your address book is restored from disk â€” you never lose your data between sessions.

- This is implemented using Python's pickle serialization protocol.
