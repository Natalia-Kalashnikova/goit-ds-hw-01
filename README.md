# üìí Contact Book (Address Book) ‚Äî Console Assistant Bot

A simple command-line contact book assistant bot written in Python 3.13, using object-oriented programming principles.

This console bot helps you manage contacts: add, edit, delete, and search for phone numbers. Contacts can have multiple phone numbers, and each phone number is validated (must be exactly 10 digits). Additionally, contacts can store a birthday date, which is validated and used to track upcoming birthdays and send timely greetings.

This address book is automatically saved to disk when you exit the program and restored when you start it again, so you never lose your contacts!

---

## üíæ Data Persistence

- All your contacts and their data are automatically saved to a file (addressbook.pkl) when you exit the program.
- When you start the program again, your address book is restored from disk ‚Äî you never lose your data between sessions.
- This is implemented using Python's pickle serialization protocol.

## üê≥ Dockerization

You can also run this project inside a Docker container.

### 1. Build the Docker image

Run the following command in the root directory of the project:

`docker build -t contact-book-app .`


This command will:

  - Use the official Python 3.13 slim image as the base.
  - Copy the project files into the container.
  - Install dependencies using Poetry.
  - Set up the working directory at /goit-ds-hw-01.

### 2. Run the container

After building the image, start the container with:

`docker run -p 3000:3000 contact-book-app`


This will:

  - Expose the app on port 3000 (accessible at http://localhost:3000)

  - Run the main program using:

`python -m contact_book.main`

### 3. Manage containers

To check running containers:

`docker ps`


To stop a container:

`docker stop <container_id>`

### 4. Example workflow

Build the image

`docker build -t contact-book-app .`

Run the container

`docker run -d -p 3000:3000 contact-book-app`

View logs

`docker logs <container_id>`
